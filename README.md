# 21 Days Challenge - WebDevelopment

This is a Portfolio Website project build as a part of my project during the 21DaysChallenge. I tried to implement routing without page-reload using javascript and css which turned out useful for small scale projects.

# Technologies:
- HTML/CSS
- SASS
- Javascript

(No template/framework has been used in building the website.)
